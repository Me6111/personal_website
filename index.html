        At [Dublin Business School, (Ireland)], I was fully engaged in a culture that cut beyond national boundaries. 
        My study abroad experience allowed me to engage with many cultural landscapes, make friendships with other international students, and negotiate a new academic system. 
        It was a profound investigation of both the intellectual and personal sides of education.
        I was born at Perth, Australia, and did my pre-schooling at that place for a couple of years, after that I returned to my country (Bangladesh) and started my formal academic education. 
        Stories of intellectual achievements, personal development, and cross-cultural interactions can be found in this area. 
        No matter how varied, each entry embodies the essence of my international education. 
        My perspective has changed as a result of the challenges and rewards of acclimating to a new educational setting and the joy of establishing friendships with peers from around the globe.
